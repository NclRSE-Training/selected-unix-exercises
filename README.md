# Selected unix exercises and diagrams

These are intended to be shown to workshop participants just by showing them the `main.md` file. This means formatting within the solution dropdown is preserved (unlike using Pages). I tend to zoom in so that students can only view one exercise at a time (to prevent students skipping ahead).
